# LD37
Ludum Dare 37 for Team Unity

Mrs. Slitherkins the snake wakes up in a hospital -- burned, poisoned, and very confused. Confined to a bed, all she can do is accept the visitors who might be trying to murder her: a ruthless businessgiraffe, a slippery penguin, and a panicking mouse. Help Mrs. Slitherkins endure the jabs of a rabbit, uncover a conspiracy, and fund her ice-skating dreams -- all in the five days before her death. 

All artwork, story and music were all created during the event.
