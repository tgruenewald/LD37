Choice|Yes, I can hear you.~line,next|-hiss-~line,next|Let me sleep.~line,next
|Listen carefully, Mrs. Slitherkins. You've had a terrible accident. A bomb exploded in your shoe shop.|Nurse
|A bomb? You jolt awake to find your tail in a cast and your head in a headache, but you have only one thought.|
|My son! Is he--?|You
|Alive, but unconscious still. Your shoe inventory was not so fortunate.|Nurse
|Not that it was ever alive.|Nurse
|She chortles to herself.|
|How long until I can leave?|You
|Your burns will heal, Mrs. Slitherkins, as soon as you are able to shed your skin. However, that may never happen. During your medical examination, we discovered poison in your veins.|Nurse
|Someone tried to murder me ... twice?|You
|Apparently so! Someone with a sense of humor.|Nurse
|What's so funny?|You
|A poisoned snake!|Nurse
Choice|Ha. Ha. Very amusing.~line,next|I am not a poisonous snake.~line,next|What type of poison is it?~line,next
|Poisoned, but not poisonous! Ahahaha! Ahem.|Nurse
|Whatever venom is in your veins is slow-acting, but quite thorough. You have only five days to live.|Nurse
|Five days! Is it time to put your affairs in order? Say farewell to family and friends? Splurge on some final roller coaster rides?|
|Nope, you have a mystery to solve!|
|I need to speak to the police.|You
|They're busy solving more important crimes.|Nurse
|More important than a murder that is in progress?|You
|More important than a snake.|Nurse
|She wrinkles her pink nose in disdain.|
|What, did a snake eat your parents?|You
|Yes, actually.|Nurse
|Awkward.|
|You have visitors, but you are weak. You may only have one visitor every day.|Nurse
|What's the point of limiting me to one visitor a day if I'm going to die soon anyway?|You
|Two visitors at once will overtax you and you will die even sooner.|Nurse
|This logic seems flawed, but the nurse will not be moved, and given the pain in your tail, you won't be moving either.|
|Very well.|You
startday|Three visitors have come to see you. A giraffe, a mouse, and a penguin. Who will you meet with today?|Nurse

|You should ask to be relocated to a higher floor. I have to bend down to talk to you and it is highly uncomfortable. Or should I say ... lowly?|Girwoffe
|Of course. It's Girwoffe, your longtime business rival. To drive you out of business, he's been cutting his prices like a beaver cutting trees.|
Choice|Did you come here to gloat?~line,giraffe.business|So slashing prices wasn't enough, now you're slashing throats?~line,next
|You are crass, as usual.|Girwoffe
giraffe.business|The giraffe attempts to stretch pompously. His task is rather impossible, since you can only see the head.|
|I am here on business.|Girwoffe
|I was planning to speak to you earlier today, but then this unfortunate accident happened. However, your business was already floundering, Mrs. Slitherskins. You and your son are both hospitalized, and someone has to pay the medical bills.|Girwoffe
|You must sell your shoe business to me for five thousand. What do you say?|Girwoffe
|I heard the explosion only destroyed part of my inventory.|You
|Hmph. Six thousand then. That's my final offer.|Girwoffe

giraffe.sell|Excellent! I will have the money transferred to your account right away. Wow, if I had known you would break this easily I would have hired someone to burn down your shop years ago!~SetFlag,giraffe.sold,T:SetFlag,giraffe.exhaust,T:line,next|Girwoffe
|Not that I hired anyone this time, of course. So tell whoever really burned your shop that I owe them a favor. I suspect it was that tiny penguin. He once asked me whether I would help him expand his business to the upper floor, but he seemed to be suggesting something quite illegal so I ended that conversation right away.|Girwoffe
|Because I would never do anything illegal. And it turns out I didn't even need to!|Girwoffe

Choice|I apologize. Still, I will not sell.~line,giraffe.refusecont|I would demand an apology, but it would take you too long to swallow your pride.~line,next
|Snakes don't even wear shoes! Your store was always doomed to fail!|Girwoffe
|The giraffe quivers with such rage that he strikes his head on the window frame, then barks in pain. The sound is distinctly not giraffe-like.|
|He looks ready to headbutt you, which could be lethal in your condition.|
Choice|Okay, I apologize, but I refuse to sell.~line,giraffe.refusecont|On the other hand, it's a good thing your neck is so long, because your shoes smell.~line,next

|He's a wolf.~SetFlag.giraffe.appears,F:SetFlag,weregiraffe.appears,T|

|Another two minutes pass before the nurse hops calmly into the room.|

|Very funny, Mrs. Slitherkins. There's nothing there. Now, next time you feel a need to exercise your vocal cords, press the emergency button. That's what it's for.|Nurse
