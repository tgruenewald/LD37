|Listen carefully, Mrs. Slitherkins. You've had a terrible accident. A bomb exploded in your shoe shop.|Nurse
|A bomb? You jolt awake to find your tail in a cast and your head in a headache, but you have only one thought.~line,startday4|
|My son! Is he--?|You
|Alive, but unconscious still. Your shoe inventory was not so fortunate.|Nurse
|Not that it was ever alive.|Nurse
|She chortles to herself.|
|How long until I can leave?|You
|Your burns will heal, Mrs. Slitherkins, as soon as you are able to shed your skin. However, that may never happen. During your medical examination, we discovered poison in your veins.|Nurse
|Someone tried to murder me ... twice?|You
|Apparently so! Someone with a sense of humor.|Nurse
|What's so funny?|You
|A poisoned snake!|Nurse
Choice|Ha. Ha. Very amusing.~line,next|I am not a poisonous snake.~line,next|What type of poison is it?~line,nurse.poison

nurse.poison|Whatever venom is in your veins is slow-acting, but quite thorough. If not for the explosion, it wouldn't have been discovered until too late.|Nurse
|Neverthless, you have only five days to live.|Nurse
|Five days! Is it time to put your affairs in order? Say farewell to family and friends? Splurge on some final roller coaster rides?|
|Nope, you have a mystery to solve!|
|I need to speak to the police.|You
|They're busy solving more important crimes.|Nurse
|More important than a murder that is in progress?|You
|More important than a snake.|Nurse
|She wrinkles her pink nose in disdain.|
|What, did a snake eat your parents?|You
|Yes, actually.|Nurse
|Awkward.|
|You have visitors, but you are weak. You may only have one visitor every day.|Nurse
|What's the point of limiting me to one visitor a day if I'm going to die soon anyway?|You
|Two visitors at once will overtax you and you will die even sooner.|Nurse
|This logic seems flawed, but the nurse will not be moved, and given the pain in your tail, you won't be moving either.|
|Very well.|You

|There was no school tomorrow, so he was reminding me not to wake him up for breakfast.|You
